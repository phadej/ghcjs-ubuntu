#
# on Windows, we cannot reliably run wrapper scripts. Therefore we run the executable
# directly and have it read this file for extra arguments to prepend on the command line.
# It has to be in the same path as the executable and have the same name, with the
# .options extension appended.
#
# Every non-empty line not starting with a hash is treated as one argument
# the Setup program does the same variable substitution as it does with the wrapper scripts
